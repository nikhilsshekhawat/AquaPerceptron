# ROV Vision System Guide

We have generated a complete multi-threaded vision and control pipeline with code, calibration tools, documentation, and testing scripts.

Key Files:
- rov_vision_system.py — Main application
- calibration.py — Calibration & testing utilities
- test_system.py — Component + integration tests
- ServoController Arduino code (embedded in rov_vision_system.py)
- config.yaml — All tunable parameters
- setup.sh & requirements.txt — One-command environment setup
- DOCUMENTATION.md & README.md — Detailed docs

This guide walks you through hardware wiring, software install, calibration, and mission execution under water.

For full instructions open DOCUMENTATION.md and README.md.

Happy exploring!
